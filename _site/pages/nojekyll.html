<p>If you want a plain website without all of this
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>/<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
business, you just need to fill the repository with plain html and css
and avoid directory names that start with underscores.</p>

<p>If you want some directories with underscores, just include a file
named <code class="highlighter-rouge">.nojekyll</code>. You might just include that anyway.  See the
<a href="https://github.com/kbroman/kbroman.github.io">source for my kbroman.github.io</a>
site.</p>

<p>I recommend using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>,
though. Markdown is just so much nicer than html, to write and
maintain.</p>

<p>Now go to <a href="local_test.html">testing your site locally</a>.</p>
